# Time-Table-Scheduling-Application

Uses Graph concepts. The project takes a text input file which contains the name and the exams each student is supposed to attend. The output will be the appropriate timetable scheduled, so that no two exams for a strudent can overlap at the same time. A graph is modeled using the data from the input file; DFS and graph coloring algorithms are applied to display the appropriate time-table schedule.
